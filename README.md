Mango's fork of st - the suckless terminal
--------------------
My customized version of the suckless terminal. 💽

Motivations
-----------
As my Linux experience is growing, I am moving away from URxvt because of its bloated source code and lack of *real* UTF-8 support 👀 As of 2018 my C programming skills suck less and I want to try to maintain my own customized fork of one of my main working tools.

Requirements
------------
Chances are, if you are spending some precious time on checking this repo, you already know what you.

Installation

Edit config.mk then run:

    make clean install

Future plans

* IBM Plex Mono font and emoji support 🌟
