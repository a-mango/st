Mango's fork of st - the suckless terminal
--------------------
My customized version of the suckless terminal. 💽

Motivations
-----------
As my Linux experience is growing, I am moving away from URxvt because of its bloated source code and lack of *real* UTF-8 support 👀 As of 2018 my C programming skills suck less and I want to try to maintain my own customized fork of one of my main working tools.
